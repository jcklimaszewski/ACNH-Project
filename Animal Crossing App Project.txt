Animal Crossing: New Horizons Guide
(ONLY MUSEUM ITEMS/FRUIT)

DESCRIPTION
For a project, I'd like to create an application to display and/or save items to a custom list to use for reference to one of my favorite video games:
Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Within the game are a plethora of collectibles to find, with many of them only appearing depending on
time of day, location, and weather conditions. With so many species to explore, a completionist may want a central location to find the information
they need to complete their collection. For that reason, I will be creating a program that will allow a registered user to not only find these
easier than on one's own, but to also allow them to create custom lists to help create a better tailored to-do list.

FEATURES

-Lists all in-game fish and insects
-Includes descriptions for each, including item name, description, location, time of day found(Where applicable)

-User functions (Login/Registration, which must be validated)
-User can also add items to 'favorites' list
-Listed objects in favorites can also be deleted (Maybe leave text area that stores notes for every entry in the list)

REQUIRED TECHNOLOGIES FOR STACK
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript/AJAX(?)
- Python
- Flask (and the flask_bcrypt and pymysql extensions)
- MySQL
